Hi I'm RJ and I'm a basketball aficionado, gym rat, and software engineer.

I completed my B.Sc. at Carnegie Mellonâ€™s School of Computer Science, majoring in computer science with a concentration in computer systems. I also had a double major in applied mathematics where I focused on computational finance. My academic interests are databases and computer systems optimization.

I like sports, traveling, enjoying films and music.
